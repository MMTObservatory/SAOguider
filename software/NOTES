The funtools rpms are orphaned in Fedora 16.  I was able to install
funtools-libs (both i686 and x86_64) from f15, but not funtools-devel. Hence,
the symbolic links lib-m*/libfuntools.so and the file src/include/fitsy.h are
included here.


It is not possible to install both the i686 and x86_64 versions of
GraphicsMagick-devel rpm at the same time.  Hence, it is not possible to build
camera_videoserver (which uses GraphicsMagick) for the version that is not
installed.


The guidegui binary appears to be a copy of a 32-bit ds9, version 3.0.2

The tcl/ subdirectory holds a copy of the tcl files sourced by guidegui.
The only changes from the original were to reroot to SAOGUIDER_ROOT.

The tcl_auto/ subdirectory is a copy of the original directory of tcl files
that are autoloaded by guidegui.  No changes.  I doubt that all the
files are really used by guidegui.

The tcl_lib/ subdirectory is a copy of the original directory of library files
that are used by some of guidegui's tcl files.  I don't know which ones.
No changes.  I doubt that all the files are really used by guidegui.

The tcl_bin/ subdirectory hold a copy of the tcl scripts to handle the
catalog access portion of videoscope_point.tcl (used only by
iccd85/guidegui.csh). No changes.  May be unused.
