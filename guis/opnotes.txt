I have added a new function to the saoguider gui that we
are now using for stella, videoscope, and mmtag.
In the full frame, hold down the ctrl key and click on a star
in the field with the left mouse button.  An offset command
will be sent to the telescope so that the star moves into the
lowest numbered active box.  If you ctrl-LMB on a star in either
of the box frames, the star will move to the center of that image.
If you also hold down the shift key, the move will be only 10%
of the distance.  This can be used for fine tuning.

Regarding the lock status,
if you are using only one star, make sure the unused
box is deactivated via the top bar guide menu.
Also, in the lower right of the guider control window,
set the lock tolerances for az and el to a non-zero value.
